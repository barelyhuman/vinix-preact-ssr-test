# vinxi-preact-ssr

A non-production setup trying out vinxi with basic preact ssr and twind's ssr css

### Current status 
- Twind's pre-rendered css doesn't work due to import path issues (code has been commented out for now), we are using the Twind CDN for the time being
- Most adapters build fine and work as expected
- The implementation is rather verbose right now so should be easy to learn from, other than the obvious magic being vinxi itself.
